# Protein-Sequence-Space

In this master's thesis project we mapped the protein sequence space of the ACE2 receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We applied structure predction algorithms to predict the three-dimensional structure of protein variants. The code provided here provides tools to analyze the output of the structure prediction algorithms.
